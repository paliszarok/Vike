# Vike (in development)

## How to build

1. [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
2. [build instructions](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki)
3. Edit raylib's path in `build.bat`
4. Edit raylib's path in `main.cpp`
5. Run `build.bat`

## How to run

You need a Vike ROM (`.vike` file) that you can drag over `Vike.exe`. These are created by writing programs in the Vike-specific programming language called *Vissembly* and compiling them using `Vike.exe`. Create a program in a `.vsm` file, drag it over `Vike.exe` and you'll get a `.vike` ROM.
